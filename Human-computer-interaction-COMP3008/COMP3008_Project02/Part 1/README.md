#CSV Processor README

The CSV processor is written in Go.

Make sure the CSVs are placed in a folder called "Working Logs" which is at the same directory level as the source.

To compile the source, make sure the Go compiler is installed.

Compile with:

    go build main.go
    
Then run the compiled file.

Alternatively, you can run without compiling with:
    
    go run main.go
