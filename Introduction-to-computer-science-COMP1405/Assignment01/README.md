### Building Image using pygame library =============>

REQUIREMENTS: To execute this program, the pygame module should be
		installed in PC.

Firstly, to generate the program by running the 
comp1405_f17_generator_a1.py with the student number.

In my case, the student number is 101094697.

so, type the following command to generate the specifications:
======    python3 comp1405_f17_generator_a1.py 101094697    ======

Now, when the specifications are generated with the goal image  
or assigned image is produced in the folder

To confirm if the programming is done correctly to build the image 
it has to run it with validator file, so the command will be:

======  python3 comp1405_f17_validator_a1.py comp1405_f17_101094697_a1.py    ====== 

ALTERNATE: for running program in simple way (without validator),
To execute the program type the following command below: 

xxxxx======    python3 comp1405_f17_101094697_a1.py    ======xxxxx

This command will produce the final image as 101094697.py
