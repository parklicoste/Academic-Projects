### Falling colorful numbers game using pygame library =============>

REQUIREMENTS: To execute this program, the pygame module should be
		installed in PC.

Firstly, to generate the program by running the 
comp1405_f17_generator_a3.py with the student number.

In my case, the student number is 101094697.

so, type the following command to generate the specifications:
======    python3 comp1405_f17_generator_a3.py 101094697    ======

Now, when the specifications are generated, we need to check for errors.

To confirm if the programming is done correctly to run the program
it has to run it with validator file, so the command will be:

======  python3 comp1405_f17_validator_a3.py comp1405_f17_101094697_a3.py    ====== 

then
To execute the program type the following command below: 

xxxxx======    python3 comp1405_f17_101094697_a3.py    ======xxxxx

This command will produce the pygame window and run the numbering snake 
until it finds a way to the end.
