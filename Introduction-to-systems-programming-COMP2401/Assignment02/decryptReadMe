We are also decrypting by adding a code in the main program.Commands for compiling the reciver program is: 
gcc -o decrypt decrypt.c bit_manipulation.c                                
                                                                           
And  the compilation command for debugging is :
gcc -g -o decrypt decrypt.c bit_manipulation.c
Example message is :- 0-51 -63 -70 -97 102 -63 -2 -47 56 -63 -52 -75 86 -61 -64
